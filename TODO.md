# TODO for Fixing Logs and Graph Pages

- [x] Add proxy to client/package.json to forward API requests to server
- [x] Install Chart.js in client for graph visualization
- [x] Update Graph.js to render pie chart for spending by category and line chart for monthly trends
- [x] Ensure server is running (start with npm run dev in server directory)
